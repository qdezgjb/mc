"""
Cleanup Orphaned Records from SQLite Database

Removes records that reference deleted parent records (orphaned foreign keys).
This should be run BEFORE migration to clean up the database.

Usage:
    python scripts/db/cleanup_orphaned_records.py

    # With options:
    python scripts/db/cleanup_orphaned_records.py --live
    python scripts/db/cleanup_orphaned_records.py --live --yes

Options:
    --live    Actually delete orphaned records (default is dry-run mode)
    --yes     Skip confirmation prompt (useful for non-interactive execution)

Examples:
    # Dry run (default - shows what would be deleted without actually deleting)
    python scripts/db/cleanup_orphaned_records.py

    # Actually delete orphaned records (with confirmation)
    python scripts/db/cleanup_orphaned_records.py --live

    # Delete without confirmation prompt
    python scripts/db/cleanup_orphaned_records.py --live --yes

Note: This script can be run from any directory. It will automatically
      find the SQLite database using DATABASE_URL environment variable
      or by checking common locations (data/mindgraph.db, /root/mindgraph/, etc.).
