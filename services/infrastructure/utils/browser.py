Browser Manager for MindGraph

Simple browser manager that creates a fresh browser instance for each request.
This approach ensures reliability and isolation between requests.

Features:
- Fresh browser instance per request
- Automatic cleanup of browser resources
- Optimized browser configuration for PNG generation
- Thread-safe operations
- Support for offline Chromium installation (browsers/chromium/)
