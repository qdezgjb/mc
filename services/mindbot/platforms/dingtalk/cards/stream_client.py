"""DingTalk Stream SDK manager — background WebSocket for AI card callbackType=STREAM.

The Stream SDK WebSocket connection is required by DingTalk before it will accept
``createAndDeliver`` with ``callbackType: "STREAM"`` for group AI cards.  Streaming
content is still pushed via REST ``PUT /v1.0/card/streaming`` — the WebSocket is only
needed as a registration/validation channel; it also receives card interaction callbacks
(button clicks etc.) which we ACK without further action.

Operations
----------
- Expect **one** Stream SDK client per distinct DingTalk app ``client_id`` in a process.
  Multiple orgs sharing the same app reuse the same client.
- Clients are cleared only on process shutdown (``stop_all``). After **mass credential
  churn** or rotating many distinct apps in one long-lived worker, **restart uvicorn
  workers** so stale entries are dropped (rare in production).
