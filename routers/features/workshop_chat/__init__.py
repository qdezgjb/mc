"""
Workshop Chat REST Router Package
====================================

Domain-split router structure inspired by Zulip's ``zerver/views/`` pattern.

Sub-modules mirror the service layer:

- ``channels``         Channel CRUD, join/leave, member listing, org members
- ``topics``           Topic lifecycle (study cases)
- ``messages``         Channel and topic messages, edit/delete
- ``direct_messages``  DM conversations and messaging

Shared concerns:

- ``schemas``          Pydantic request/response models
- ``dependencies``     Reusable access-control helpers (Zulip-style)

Access control: Admins, managers, or users in WORKSHOP_CHAT_PREVIEW_ORG_IDS
(preview/testing while the module is under development).
